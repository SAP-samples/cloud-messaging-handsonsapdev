# Contributing

If you wish to raise an issue, please use the [issues](issues) facility in this repo, but bear in mind the scope of support described above. If you wish to contribute code, offer fixes or improvements, please send a pull request (PR). Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) on submitting their first PR to this project. This DCO acceptance can be done in the PR itself - look out for the CLA assistant that will guide you through the simple process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
